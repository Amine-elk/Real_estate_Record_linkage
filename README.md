# Real_estate_Record_linkage

This project aims to provide a simple approach to how we can deal with the problem of linking records in real estate applications with many different strategies.

We use the following steps:

    - Database clean-up.

    - Imputation of missing information.

    - Exploiting the record description to fill in missing values in the database.

    - Reducing the problem size by creating a first group using the Kmeans algorithm.

    - Description filtering.
    
    - Construction of a similarity matrix as the final step in the approach to calculate similarity and eliminate duplicate listings.
